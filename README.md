Persona: Marketing Manager - Ulia

Goal: Increase engagement and reward end users for their actions and/or spend with the retail brand selling clothes online and offline (to increase loyalty)

How: Create an automated game challenge for their end users to invite their friends and engage with. (Includes a leader board and getting reward (s) after completion)

Intent: Looking for a software (online tool) that allows her to create this game, select from a list of triggers (user actions, spend) and give rewards  and declare the reward.

Assumptions:

- Assume Rewards are already set-up on the dashboard for the Marketing Manager to choose from
- There are actions to complete for the Challenge:
<li>Download the brand app (action)</li>
<li>Spend 100 SGD at the local store (transaction)</li>
<li>Share progress on Social Media (action)</li>
- Assume target audience is already pre-defined on the dashboard. Whoever starts engaging in the beginning becomes part of the pool of users in the journey for the leaderboard challenge
- The end user experience is not required to be wireframed
- Make any other assumptions necessary but state them explicitly

Inspirations:

- Grab Challenges in-app
- Lazada challenge
 

Tasks:

- User Flow for this goal
- Lo-Fi Wireframe of the steps involved for the Marketing Manager to be able to set this up on a dashboard
